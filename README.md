# 📊 B2B Data Engineering & Professional Analytics Pipeline

An end-to-end **B2B Data Engineering and Analytics Pipeline** designed to automate web data extraction, perform structured data cleaning, and generate **industry-grade analytical visualizations** for business intelligence and dashboard integration.

This project demonstrates real-world practices in:

- Automated web scraping  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- KPI generation  
- Professional data visualization  
- Dashboard-ready reporting  

The pipeline follows a complete workflow:

> Scrape → Clean → Analyze → Visualize → Export  

Built with scalability, performance, and professional reporting standards in mind.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Modern businesses rely heavily on structured insights derived from unorganized web data. Manual data collection and analysis are slow, error-prone, and not scalable.

This project solves that problem by implementing a **production-style B2B analytics pipeline** that:

- Automatically extracts product and supplier data  
- Cleans and standardizes raw datasets  
- Generates business KPIs  
- Produces exactly **10 professional analytical charts**  
- Exports outputs as PNG + Base64 (dashboard-ready for Django / web apps)  

The system is optimized for large datasets and uses a fast, stable visualization backend suitable for enterprise environments.

## 🧩 Business Problem Statement

B2B platforms contain massive volumes of unstructured product and supplier information. Organizations often struggle to transform this data into actionable insights.

### Key challenges addressed:

- Manual data collection overhead  
- Inconsistent and noisy raw data  
- Lack of structured KPIs  
- Absence of visualization-ready outputs  
- Difficulty integrating analytics into dashboards  

This pipeline converts raw web data into **decision-ready business intelligence**.

## 📈 Analytics & Visualizations (Exactly 10)

1. KPI Cards / Scorecards  
2. Line Chart (Trend Analysis)  
3. Bar Chart (City-wise Distribution)  
4. Column Chart (State-wise Distribution)  
5. Donut / Pie Chart (Price Bucket Share)  
6. Histogram (Price Distribution)  
7. Map Chart (City Index / Geographic Approximation)  
8. Combo Chart (Bar + Line)  
9. Treemap (Category Contribution)  
10. Scatter Plot (Price vs Rating / Density Analysis)  

These charts are designed using consistent color palettes and labeling conventions to match industry dashboard standards.
